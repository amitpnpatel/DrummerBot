[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/wdavidw/node-buffered-stream.png)](http://travis-ci.org/wdavidw/node-buffered-stream)

This module create a Stream which implement both the writer and reader API. The content written to the stream is buffered at a defined size and later flushed into the final destination stream. Use the buffered stream to increase writing speed.

Quick example
-------------

The example below will buffer the data from i readable stream and send them to a writeable stream as 16 Mo chunks.

```javascript
buffered = require('buffered-stream');

reader = createStreamReader();
buffer = buffered(4*1024*1024);
writer = createStreamWriter();

reader.pipe(buffer).pipe(writer);
```

Development
-----------

Tests are executed with mocha. To install it, simple run `npm install`, it will install
mocha and its dependencies in your project "node_modules" directory.

To run the tests:
```bash
npm test
```

The tests run against the CoffeeScript source files.

To generate the JavaScript files:
```bash
make build
```

The test suite is run online with [Travis][travis] against Node.js version 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9.
